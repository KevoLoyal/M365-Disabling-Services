About me

I can't provide you with support, more than the usual issues on GitHub.
This is not a Microsoft-Supported repo. This is a personal supported repo.
As per the license and so on, I CAN'T GUARANTEE that everything will work as expected. Most of the scripts are unfinished so you can build your own.
Thanks for getting until here, and please feel free to explore the repo, clone it, add issues and even do a PR to add your owns (please make sure to mark your scripts with the corresponding licensing headers and explicitly mark yourself as the author, as I don't want to take credit for your work).

Everything made by me, should be MIT license. If not, please let me know so I can apply the license; please note that I'll be doing this by hand so any pointer in how to do it automatically will be appreciated.
